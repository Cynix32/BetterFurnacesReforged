# BetterFurnacesReforged
Resume

This mod project plans to rewrite the old Better Furnaces 
mod for the new versions, adapting it to the new Minecraft concepts, but without leaving its 
old look.


Objective and Thanks

I have no financial interests in this, the fun and knowledge acquired to do it are the most important.  Parts of code from o

ther open source mods were used for certain elements.  The Furnaces Overhaul mod code base was completely used to make version 1.12, without it it wouldn't be possible to have this level of optimization and features of the new update
